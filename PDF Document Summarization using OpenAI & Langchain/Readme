Key Concept: Vector Embeddings

Legal Document Summarization with Langchain
Overview:
This script extracts, processes, and summarizes content from documents (e.g., lease contract) using Langchain and OpenAI embeddings. It efficiently identifies and retrieves key information for faster document review.

Key Features:

PDF Reading: Extracts text from PDF legal documents.
Text Splitting: Breaks down text into manageable chunks while preserving context.
Embeddings: Converts text chunks into semantic vectors using OpenAI, enabling smart querying.
Summarization: Quickly summarizes and highlights critical details from legal documents.

How It Works?

Extract: Read and parse the entire PDF document.
Process: Split the text into meaningful chunks.
Embed: Generate embeddings to capture the semantic meaning.
Query: Search and retrieve relevant sections or summaries based on natural language queries.
Use Case:
Ideal for summarizing legal contracts and extracting essential information quickly and accurately.

Benefits: 

Efficiency: Reduces time spent on manual document review.Accuracy: Captures critical information even when worded differently.
