We delved into the fascinating realm of style transfer techniques applied to the visual arts, harnessing the power of deep learning methods to inspire and provide innovative solutions for
emerging artists. Our exploration began with an extensive literature review, where we delved into the historical context and evolution of AI in art, with a specific focus on generative 
art and the advancements made in deep learning models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
